**Node.js** is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 
It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser and run it as a standalone application on a server or a computer.

**Asynchronous and Non-Blocking:** Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This means that it can handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently without blocking the execution of other tasks. 

**NPM (Node Package Manager):** Node.js comes with a powerful package manager called NPM, which provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and modules. 

**Use Cases:** Node.js is commonly used for building server-side applications, APIs, real-time web applications (e.g., chat applications, gaming servers), microservices,

##### Anonymous Functions 

```JavaScript
const functionName = function(parameter1, parameter2) {
    // anonymous function
};
Example of a function expression:

javascript
Copy code
const addNumbers = function(a, b) {
    return a + b; // it can be used as a value assigned to a variable.
};

function doSomething(callback) {
    console.log("Doing something...");
    callback(); // Execute the callback function
}

// Using an anonymous function as the callback
doSomething(function() {
    console.log("Callback executed!");
});
```

 An anonymous function is a function that does not have a name. They are useful when you need to create a function on the fly without assigning it a permanent name. Anonymous functions are commonly used in situations where a function is required for a specific task, but it doesn't need to be referenced by name elsewhere in the code. There is no anonynmous function in Java
##### Arrow Anonymous Function 

```JavaScript
const myFunction = (parameter1, parameter2) => {  };
const multiplyNumbers = (a, b) => a * b;
```
